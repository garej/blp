# blp
Random coefficients logit model of demand proposed by Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995) (thus, BLP).
This is Wolfram Mathematica version of famous Nevo's Matlab code with toy BLP example for educational purposes.
Mathematica version has several advantages for education.
1) it is much shorter and is kept in one file
2) it is immutable, so each step can be studied separately 
3) optimisation needs no jacobian (aka gradient)

We keep naming of variables and functions after Nevo's code where apropriate.
BLP_import folder has .xlsx files with input data structured as in Nevo (1998).
